						<p>Hong Kong is at a pivotal moment as it aims to establish itself as an international innovation and technology (I&T) center. The government's strategic initiatives focus not only on nurturing emerging industries but also on integrating innovative technologies into traditional businesses, ensuring their competitiveness in a rapidly evolving market. In this context, angel and venture capital (VC) investment is crucial, acting as both a catalyst for innovation and a bridge between cutting-edge technology and established firms.</p>
                        <p>Angel and VC investments are vital for creating a robust startup ecosystem that can develop technologies necessary for traditional businesses. Startups often emerge with unique solutions to the challenges faced by established industries. However, launching a startup is challenging, with a low success rate. To foster innovation, Hong Kong must build a pipeline that allows for the formation of numerous startups, increasing the likelihood that a few will succeed each year.  Besides government initiatives and funding, private sector participation and the involvement of a considerable population of early stage professional venture investors are essential elements of any successful I&T ecosystem.</p>
                        <p>The government’s commitment to creating a conducive I&T environment is evident through various initiatives, including innovation parks and funding schemes for research and development. However, the full potential of these initiatives can only be realized when traditional businesses actively engage with the startup ecosystem. Collaborating with innovative firms enables traditional businesses to harness advanced technologies and to drive economic growth.</p>
                        <p>As Hong Kong strives to become a leading I&T center, the interplay between angel and venture capital investment and traditional businesses is essential. By investing in startups that develop innovative AI technologies, investors can help create solutions that enhance efficiency and competitiveness. This synergy will be key to realizing Hong Kong’s vision of a dynamic and resilient economy.</p>
